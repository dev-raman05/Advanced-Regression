# Advanced House Price Regression Analysis
This project leverages advanced regression techniques to predict housing prices using a comprehensive Kaggle dataset. The workflow begins with extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key trends, identify data anomalies, and understand feature relationships. Robust feature engineering was applied, including handling missing values, scaling, one-hot encoding of categorical variables, and applying log-transformations to normalize skewed distributions.
Multiple regression approaches were explored—ranging from linear regression with regularization techniques (ridge and lasso) to ensemble methods—to build and refine predictive models. Model performance was rigorously evaluated using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared, and further enhanced through systematic hyperparameter tuning via grid search and cross-validation. Effective data visualization techniques were employed to illustrate model insights, feature importance, and residual diagnostics, ensuring the model's interpretability and reliability.
This project not only demonstrates proficiency in advanced statistical modeling and machine learning but also showcases the practical application of these techniques in a competitive data science environment.
